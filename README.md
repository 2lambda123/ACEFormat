# ACEFormat
This repository contains the specification for the ACE format---as well as a few supporting formats. 

The information contained in this document was formerly Appendix F of the MCNP5 manual, but has been put in its own document to enable wider distribution.

Currently the manual only contains a portion of the full specification. More will be added in time

## Issues
If you discover problems with the specification, please [file an issue](https://github.com/NuclearData/ACEFormat/issues) on GitHub. This will allow those involved to investigate and keep a record of what has been done.
