# ACE&mdash;A Compact ENDF$mdash;ormat Specification
This repository contains the specification for the ACE format&mdash;as well as a few supporting formats. 

The information contained in this document was formerly Appendix F of the MCNP5 manual, but has been put in its own document to enable wider distribution. Currently the specification only contains a portion of the full specification. More will be added in time.

The document itself is [ACEFormat.pdf](ACEFormat.pdf) and can be downloaded/viewed without having to clone or download the entire repository.

Please note: **this document is not complete at this time.**

## Issues
If you discover problems with the specification, please [file an issue](https://github.com/NuclearData/ACEFormat/issues) on GitHub. This will allow those involved to investigate and keep a record of what has been done. Note that we are not modifying or extending the format at this time; we are only looking for bugs in the format specification.
